# Implement your project into AvatarConnect

AvatarConnect In Unity works by implementing each provider as a Module class; this class handles all runtime events that you can customize or change depending on what your project requires.

To begin adding support for your project, you'll need your partner folder; create one like this:
`partners/<Your Project>`
Feel free to structure your project after your preference, but we do suggest keeping a `partners/<Your Project>/module.cs` at your root that implements the main.cs.
